            <p>
                My name is Gracie Hutchins, and I am the co-founder of Silver Fox Studios (SFS), alongside my cousin, Gabrielle Cheek. We began developing the story for Seas of Secrets (SOS) in 2018, and by 2022, we transitioned from story to gameplay. Originally, we envisioned SOS as a cartoon, but after a few humorous attempts at animation that made us question our artistic talents, we decided that a game would be a better fit for our vision. Today, we’re proud to work with a small but dedicated team, including our talented music producer, game testers, and general helpers, all of whom have been essential in bringing SOS to life. Explore our website to learn more about our journey and the creation of SOS!

            <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
            <p>
                Behind the scenes, we use Game Maker to bring Seas of Secrets to life. While Game Maker provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the development process, creating the game has still required a lot of hard work and dedication. In fact, our early versions were horribly programmed, filled with bugs and broken mechanics. Over time, we’ve learned to improve our skills and refine our work, spending countless hours designing sprites, coding mechanics, and ensuring everything runs smoothly. Game Maker may be an accessible engine, but mastering it takes serious effort. Every detail in the game, from character animations to complex interactions, reflects the long journey we’ve taken to make our vision a reality.

                <p>
                    Game Maker is an excellent engine for developing 2D games. We chose this engine for its intuitive interface and powerful features, including its built-in art creation tools. These tools streamline the process by allowing us to create and edit sprites directly within the engine, eliminating the need to constantly import and export assets. With over 1,000 sprites in SOS, this feature has saved us significant time and effort. While this isn’t a sponsored endorsement, we genuinely appreciate the convenience and efficiency Game Maker offers.

                    While Game Maker is our primary tool for art, we occasionally turn to Procreate for its unique advantages. Procreate offers a range of custom brushes and features that enhance our creative process. Its smooth interface and organizational capabilities are particularly valuable when working with large assets, making it an excellent complement to our main workflow.

                    Although I didn’t personally use FL Studio much, it was the go-to tool for our music producer, who absolutely nailed the soundtrack for Seas of Secrets. The software's versatility and powerful features helped bring the game's music to life, and we couldn’t be happier with the final result.

            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>History of SOS</p>
            <p>
                Our journey began when my cousin and I set out to create a cartoon. After spending a lot of time developing it, we finally had something we liked. However, we quickly realized that animation wasn’t our strong suit, so we decided to shift our focus to game development instead. Growing up, we often played video games together, and Undertale was one of the games that inspired us the most.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                After writing scripts for about three-fourths of the first season and parts of season two of our cartoon, we decided to base our game on the storyline we had developed. Throughout the years, we went through several name ideas for our studio, including "Scorp and Libra" (based on our zodiac signs) and "2AC" (Two Anonymous Creators). We eventually decided against 2AC because we realized we were okay with being known. In the end, we settled on Silver Fox Studios, embracing a name that better reflected who we are. We officially began developing Seas of Secrets in 2018.
